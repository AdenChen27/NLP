3. Rate each topic label independently on a scale of 0 to 1, based on how well it describes the content of the news article. (Each rating is independent and doesn't need to add up to 1.)
4. Rate each sentiment label independently on a scale of 0 to 1, based on how well it describes the tone of the news article. (Each rating is independent and doesn't need to add up to 1.)
